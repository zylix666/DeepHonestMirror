# DeepHonestMirror
This is an application showing how to use openCV, Caffe, Qt to detect face and recognize age and gender.

# Installation guide
## Dependencies
   1. Caffe. https://github.com/BVLC/caffe
      My operating system is Ubuntu 16.04. Please see Caffe installation instruction. http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html
   2. OpenCV 2.4. 
      You can use Ubuntu apt to install OpenCV libraries.
   3. Qt 5.8 or Qt 5.7.1
      You can download Qt from https://www.qt.io/download/
      This project is built with Qt Creator

## Model download.
* This project is inspired by "Age and Gender Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks". I cannot make it without the models. http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/
* This is a very interested research. I strongly recommend you to read through the paper.

I did not retrain the model. Just apply the pre-built model.
If you are interested in retraining the model to improve it, the author also provide the training script. https://github.com/GilLevi/AgeGenderDeepLearning

* To download the pre-built model, you can visit the Gist page. https://gist.github.com/GilLevi/c9e99062283c719c03de

## The model folder.
You should download the model files and put them into the build folder .
For example, /home/simonli/build-DeepHonestMirror-Desktop_Qt_5_8_0_GCC_64bit-Debug/models
like below:

## Models and taglist
I put the tar ball here but not guarantee to download.

## Execution result.
https://www.dropbox.com/s/9rj7g8ihujkcd6r/2017-06-21%2000-03-22%20%E7%9A%84%E8%9E%A2%E5%B9%95%E6%93%B7%E5%9C%96.png?dl=0
The above screenshot is Image mode. If you want to use camera mode, just uncheck the Image mode box, then click "preview" button, you will see face detection and click Analyze to see the result.
The accuracy is not guaranteed for both image mode and camera mode.

#TODO
There are still many bugs of this application. Will fix them in the future.
